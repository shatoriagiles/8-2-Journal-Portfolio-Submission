### Module Eight Journal

<p>
  The Gaming Room was the client, and they wanted to expand their game Draw It or Lose It from just an Android app into a web-based version that works on many platforms. 
  I think I did really well in explaining the client’s needs and breaking down how the software would work across different systems. 
  Writing the design document helped me a lot because it made me plan before coding, so I had a clear idea of what the program should do. 
  If I could revise one part, I would improve the diagrams and make them easier to understand. 
  To meet the user’s needs, I focused on making the software flexible, secure, and easy to use, because users need smooth gameplay no matter what device they use. 
  Considering the user’s needs is important since they are the ones actually playing the game, and bad design could turn them away. 
  When designing the software, I started by looking at the requirements, then used strategies like breaking the system into smaller parts and following object-oriented programming. In the future, 
  I would use more visual tools, like flowcharts and models, to make sure both the client and developers understand the design better.
